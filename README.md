# Extensibility Tools for Visual Studio

Updated to support VS 2019, I updated this extension to modify the VuePack2017.

> NOTE: when restoring nuget, might need to update `Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextTemplating.VSHost.14.0` to version below to successful compile.

_packages.config_
```xml
<package id="Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextTemplating.VSHost.14.0" version="14.3.25407" targetFramework="net45" />
```

### VSCT files
The Visual Studio Command Table leaves a lot to be desired in terms of
both Intellisense and discoverability of even the most common use cases.

This extension improves on that.

#### Intellisense for custom GUIDs
Get Intellisense for symbols and groups through out the .vsct file
whether you're defining `Groups`, `Menus`, `Buttons`, `KeyBindings` or 
`CommandPlacements`.

![VSCT Intellisense GUIDs](art/vsct-intellisense-guid.png)

#### Intellisense for custom IDs
Provides Intellisense for IDs based on the `guid` attribute on
the same XML element.

![VSCT Intellisense IDs](art/vsct-intellisense-id.png)

#### Intellisense built-in groups and menus
All the built-in groups and menus are located under the `guidSHLMainMenu`
GUID and Intellisense is now provided for all the corresponding IDs.

![VSCT Intellisense groups menus](art/vsct-intellisense-builtin.png)

#### ImageMoniker Intellisense
Over 3500 images is available as ImageMonikers in the KnownMonikers
collection in VS. You can now see all the images directly inside
Intellisense.

![VSCT Intellisense groups menus](art/image-monikers.png)

#### Snippets
All main XML elements in the VSCT file has snippets associated with
them and can be invoked by hitting the Tab key.

![VSCT snippets](art/vsct-snippets.gif)

#### Auto-sync VSCT commands
Auto-generate the `PackageGuids` and `PackageIds` classes every time
you save the VSCT file. This keeps your code in sync with the VSCT file
at all times.

### Editor margin
The margin is located below the bottom scrollbar and comes in handy
when writing extensions that extends the VS editor.

![Bottom margin](art/margin.png)

#### Document encoding
Shows the encoding of the current document and more details on hover.

![Document encoding](art/margin-encoding.png)

#### Content type
Shows the content type of the `ITextBuffer` at the caret position. The
over tooltip shows the name of the base content type.

#### Classification
Displays the name of the classification at the caret position in the
document. The hover tooltip shows the inheritance hierarchy of the
`EditorFormatDefinition`'s `BaseDefinition` attribute.

![Classifications](art/margin-classification.png)

#### Selection
Displays the start and end position of the editor selection as
well as the total length of the selection.

![Selection](art/margin-selection.png)

### Pkgdef files

#### Syntax highlighting
Colorizes registry keys, strings, keywords, comments and more.

![Pkgdef colorization](art/pkgdef-colorization.png)

#### Intellisense
Intellisense is provided for tokens and GUIDs.

![Pkgdef token Intellisense](art/pkgdef-intellisense-tokens.png)

![Pkgdef token Intellisense](art/pkgdef-intellisense-guids.png)

#### Snippets
By typing a question mark on an empty line, a list of snippets appear.
Hit `Tab` on the snippet you want and it will be inserted.

![Pkgdef snippets](art/pkgdef-snippets.gif)

#### Brace matching
Matches parentheses and square brackets.

#### Validation
Validates various common mistakes like unknown tokens and unclosed strings and braces.

![Pkgdef validation](art/pkgdef-validation.png)

#### Formatting
Format the entire document or just the selected lines.

### VsixManifest files
You can enable auto-sync on any .vsixmanifest file. Simply
right-click the file in Solution Explorer and select
**Auto-sync Resx and Icon Files**.

![Auto-sync vsixmanifest](art/vsixmanifest-context-menu.png)

#### Auto-sync resx files
This will generate a file called _source.extension.resx_
that is designed to replace the _VSPackage.resx_ file
that is added by default by the VSIX project template.

Whenever you change the .vsixmanifest file, the .resx
files is updated accordingly as well.

#### Auto-sync icon file
Icon files (.ico) are always hard to create and maintain,
so this feature will auto-generate it for you automatically.

All that is required is that you've referenced an image
file in the .vsixmanifest's _Icon_ property and a new
.ico file is automtically generated with the right dimensions
for VS extensions.

#### Auto-sync C# class file
A C# class file is also produced which contains a static
class with various string constants such as Name, 
Description and Version of the VSIX.

**Example:**
```C#
namespace MyExtension
{
    public static class Vsix
    {
        public const string Id = "f86b5aa5-733c-4e8f-8d3b-ea6f9b97b344";        
        public const string Name = "Name of VSIX";
        public const string Description = "Description of VSIX";
        public const string Version = "1.0";
    }
}
```

### Support for VsixGallery.com
[VsixGallery.com](http://vsixgallery.com) is an open source
gallery for Visual Studio extensions and is primarily used
for hosting CI built extensions - a staging environment.

There are two things that make automatic integration with
VsixGallery.com easy. Put your code on GitHub and automate
the build process with [AppVeyor](http://appveyor.com).

It sounds like a lot of work, but it isn't. Right-click the
solution node in Solution Explorer and click both of the
buttons shown below.

![vsixgallery.com](art/vsixgallery-context-menu.png)

That will add some files to the solution folder that require
almost no modifications by you. These files are AppVeyor.yml
as well as common GitHub files such as CONTRIBUTION.md
(tailored to VSIX development), CHANGELOG.md etc.

[adding your extension](http://vsixgallery.com/guide/dev/)
to VsixGallery.

### Show Project Information
A context-menu command is available on every project type that
makes it very easy to see all the properties on said project.

![Show Project Information](art/show-project-information.png)

This makes it easy to troubleshoot and debug project related issues.

### Export KnownMonikers to file
You can now easily export any of the KnownMonikers from
`IVsImageService2` to a PNG file on disk in the size you
need it in.

![Export Knownmonikers](art/export-knownmonikers.png)

The button to invoke the **Export Image Moniker** dialog is
located in the top level **Tools** menu.

### Theme color swatch window
To see all the VS environment colors available used in
the Light, Blue and Dark theme, you can use the
**Theme Swatches** window.

Open it from **View -> Other Windows -> Theme Swatches**

![Theme Swatches](art/theme-swatcher-command.png)

The tool window lets you search for colors and provides an
easy way to copy them into XAML or C#.

![Theme Swatches](art/theme-swatches.png)

### View Activity Log
Getting to the Visual Studio Activity Log can sometimes
be a bit cumbersome when dealing with both the regular
and the experimental instance.

A menu command under the top level View menu let's you
open the right Activity Log easily.

![View Activity Log](art/activity-log.png)

This will open the Activity Log in the Visual Studio
web browser.

### Enable VSIP Logging
VSIP Logging allows you to see GUIDs and command ids
for menu commands. Just press **Ctrl+Shift** as you
click a menu item or group with the mouse.

![Enable VSIP Logging](art/vsiplogging.png)

Read more about 
[VSIP Logging](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dr._ex/archive/2007/04/17/using-enablevsiplogging-to-identify-menus-and-commands-with-vs-2005-sp1.aspx).

### Item Templates
Several item templates are added to make it easier to
create extension. These item templates all come with
functionality that's easy to modify to your needs.

![Item Templates](art/item-templates.png)

### Create Image Manifest files
Right-click any .png or .xaml files and invoke the
*Generate Image Manifest* command from the context menu.

This will ask you where to put the .imagemanifest file and
then generate it. If a .imagemanifest file already exist,
the guid will remain the same but the sources and IDs will
be updated.
